## Precepts
- **Decoupled**: Where possible, deleting an unessential file will not break the config. If not, changes should be easy.
- **Minimal**: Keep the config as small as possible.
- **Modular**: Adding new features is simple.
- **Readable**: From a top level view, the config should be readable and verbose. Ex: `conform.lua` instead of `formatter.lua`.

Thanks to the Neovim community. This config is simply plugins made by other pieced together in the cleanest way I can manage.
